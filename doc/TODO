London Law To-Do
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* draw a more sensible graphic when a detective lands on Mr. X's
  pushpin

* fix layout glitch with choose boxes that have undergrounds
  (looks like a wxWidgets sizer bug?)

* would be nice to have a "recent game history" display, maybe some text
  blitted up in the corner of the map ("Red Detective moved to 171 with taxi",
  etc.)

* use some sort of animation to draw attention to player movement
  (maybe just draw temporary lines on the map, Indiana-Jones style)

* come up with some way to draw alpha-blended shadows or highlights 
  around the player location markers (sure would be nice if wxWidgets
  got true alpha support) to make them more visible

* splash screen (maybe)

* would be nice to have the capability to step through all turns as a
  spectator after the game is over

* draw chat window text using the appropriate detective colors

* AI opponents (human player sends a "request AI" command to the
  server, and server launches AI opponent as a separate process that 
  automatically joins the server and registers as Mr. X or a detective)
